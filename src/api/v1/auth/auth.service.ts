/**
 * Auth Service
 *
 * Core business logic layer for authentication operations.
 * This service is responsible for:
 * - User credential validation and verification
 * - Password hashing and comparison
 * - User authentication logic
 * - Security and data protection
 *
 * The service follows the dependency injection pattern and
 * implements the AuthServiceInterface for consistency.
 *
 * Authentication operations include:
 * - Login credential verification
 * - Password security validation
 * - User data protection and sanitization
 * - Integration with user service for data access
 *
 * Security Features:
 * - Password hashing comparison using bcrypt
 * - User data sanitization (password exclusion)
 * - Secure credential validation
 * - Error handling for invalid credentials

  /**
   * Authenticates a user by validating their email and password credentials.
   * This method verifies that the email exists in the database and that
   * the provided password matches the stored hashed password.
   *
   * Error Codes:
   * - BAD_REQUEST: Invalid email or password combination
   * - NOT_FOUND: User with provided email doesn't exist
   *
   * Authentication Process:
   * - Retrieves user by email from user service
   * - Compares provided password with stored hash
   * - Validates password using bcrypt comparison
   * - Returns user data without password
   *
   * Security Measures:
   * - Uses bcrypt for secure password comparison
   * - Excludes password from returned user data
   * - Provides generic error messages for security
   * - Validates user existence before password check
   *
   * Data Protection:
   * - Password is never returned in response
   * - User data is sanitized before return
   * - Secure error handling prevents information leakage
   *
   * Integration:
   * - Uses userService for user data retrieval
   * - Uses hasherUtils for password comparison
